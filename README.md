An update to the game created by user xurxodiz on GitHub. This clone is being enhanced by Amirul and Toushik for our Project development class
 
Below are quotes from user xurxodiz

>A simple clone of the snake game, developed as my first attempt at using `canvas` and Javascript.
>
>It was originally intended for the [0hgame jam](http://0hgame.eu), but couldn't make it on time. 
>
>You can try it [live](http://diz.es/snake).

>Thankful mention to [Bill Mill's tutorial](http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial/), my starting point.
